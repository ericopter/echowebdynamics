Custom theme for echowebdynamics.com

This is the theme folder project for echowebdynamics.com. I am producing a re-usable theme that is SEO friendly for my web development company so that I can later try to sell it as a theme that has desired features that others will find easy to use, customizable and aesthetically pleasing.

Goals:
	Good SEO: I want the site to incorporate all the best "white hat" SEO practices from meta tags, links, headings and content.
	Common Features: WEB 2.0, slideshows, isotopes, portfolios and galleries.
	Integrated Features: Contact forms, media players.
	Themes: I number of ready to display default themes that are customizable, as well as the ability to design a complete theme from the ground up.
